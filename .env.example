# RevenueCat API Keys
# Get these from: https://app.revenuecat.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT/api-keys
#
# You need the PUBLIC SDK KEY (not the secret key!)
# - Look for "Apple App Store" section
# - Copy the PUBLIC SDK KEY (starts with "appl_")
# - This key works for BOTH sandbox and production testing
#
# NOTE: If you see separate sandbox/production keys, use the appropriate ones.
# Most projects have ONE key that works for both environments.

# Apple App Store Public SDK Key
REVENUECAT_APPLE_KEY=appl_YOUR_PUBLIC_SDK_KEY_HERE

# Google Play Store Public SDK Key (if you plan to support Android)
# REVENUECAT_GOOGLE_KEY=goog_YOUR_PUBLIC_SDK_KEY_HERE

# To use this file:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env (without the .example)
# 2. Go to https://app.revenuecat.com and navigate to your project settings > API Keys
# 3. Copy your PUBLIC SDK KEY (NOT the secret key) and paste it above
# 4. Never commit the .env file to version control (it's already in .gitignore)
