**Animation Pattern:**
```typescript
Header: staggerContainer
  - Logo: staggerItem (fade in)
  - Title: staggerItem (fade in)
  - Subtitle: staggerItem (fade in)
  - Sign up link: staggerItem (fade in)

Form: staggerContainer
  - Email field: staggerItem
  - Password field: staggerItem
  - Forgot link: staggerItem
  - Submit button: staggerItem
  - Divider: staggerItem
  - Social buttons: staggerItem

All with spring physics for smooth, natural feel
```

### 2. Register Screen ✅ (`app/register/page.tsx`)

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Framer Motion staggered entrance animations
- ✅ Display name validation (min 2 chars)
- ✅ Email validation (format check)
- ✅ Password validation (min 6 chars)
- ✅ Confirm password validation (match check)
- ✅ **Password strength indicator** (NEW COMPONENT)
- ✅ Real-time validation on all fields
- ✅ Input icons (User, Mail, Lock)
- ✅ Password visibility toggle
- ✅ Terms of Service checkbox
- ✅ Privacy Policy checkbox
- ✅ Social signup UI (Google + Apple)

**New Component Created:**
`components/ui/PasswordStrength.tsx`

**Features:**
- 4-level strength indicator (Weak, Fair, Good, Strong)
- Animated progress bars (4 segments)
- Criteria checklist with check/x icons:
  - ✅ At least 6 characters
  - ✅ Contains uppercase letter
  - ✅ Contains lowercase letter
  - ✅ Contains number
- Color-coded (error, warning, primary, success)

**Validation Logic:**
```typescript
// Criteria tests
1. Length >= 6
2. Has uppercase /[A-Z]/
3. Has lowercase /[a-z]/
4. Has number /\d/

// Strength scoring
1 criterion passed = Weak (red)
2 criteria passed = Fair (yellow)
3 criteria passed = Good (primary teal)
4 criteria passed = Strong (green)
```

## Component Additions

### PasswordStrength Component
**File:** `components/ui/PasswordStrength.tsx`
**Exported:** Added to `components/ui/index.ts`

**Props:**
```typescript
interface PasswordStrengthProps {
  password: string;
  className?: string;
}
```

)}
```

**Visual Design:**
```
Password strength        Good

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Strategy
Both screens use consistent animation patterns:

1. **Container Entrance:** `fadeInUp` with spring transition
2. **Header Stagger:** Sequential fade-in for logo, title, subtitle, links
3. **Form Stagger:** Sequential fade-in for all form elements
4. **Error Animation:** Slide down from top with opacity fade

**Performance:**
- GPU-accelerated transforms (opacity, translate)
- Stagger delays: 0.1s between items
- Spring physics for natural feel
- No layout shifts (reserved space)

### Validation Strategy
Progressive validation approach:

1. **No validation on mount** - Clean initial state
2. **Validate on blur** - When user leaves field
3. **Real-time after first error** - Once error shown, validate on change
4. **Clear errors on fix** - Error disappears when criterion met
5. **Block submit if invalid** - Only valid forms can submit

**User Experience:**
- Not annoying (doesn't validate until blur)
- Helpful (shows errors immediately after blur)
- Responsive (clears errors as soon as fixed)
- Clear (specific error messages)

### Accessibility Features
- ✅ Proper label associations (`htmlFor`, `id`)
- ✅ ARIA attributes (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`)
- ✅ Semantic HTML (`button` type="submit", `form` element)
- ✅ AutoComplete attributes (email, password, name)
- ✅ Focus states (ring on focus-visible)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter works)
- ✅ Screen reader friendly (descriptive labels)

## User Flow

### Happy Path (Register → Login)
1. User lands on landing page
2. Clicks "Get Started" → `/register`
3. **Register page animates in smoothly**
4. User enters name, sees no errors
5. User enters email, validates on blur
6. User types password:
   - Strength indicator appears
   - Shows "Weak" (red) initially
   - As user adds complexity, shows "Fair" → "Good" → "Strong"
   - Criteria checkmarks update in real-time
7. User confirms password
   - Error if mismatch
   - Success (no error) if match
8. User checks Terms & Privacy
   - Checkboxes have hover states
   - Can click icons or text
9. **All valid** → Button enabled
10. Clicks "Create Account"
    - Loading state: "Creating account..."
    - Success → Redirects to `/onboarding`

### Alternate Path (Already Has Account)
1. User on register page
2. Clicks "Sign In" link
3. Navigates to `/login`
4. **Login page animates in**
5. Enters credentials
6. Clicks "Sign In"
7. Success → Redirects to `/dashboard`

## Next Steps (Onboarding)

**Ready to Build:**
1. DatePicker component (HTML5 or react-datepicker)
2. TimePicker component
3. StepWizard component
4. Migrate OnboardingScreen (3-4 steps)

**Blockers:** None - all dependencies ready

## Key Learnings

1. **PasswordStrength Component is Reusable** - Can use in profile password change, anywhere passwords are set
2. **Stagger Animation Pattern Works Great** - Feels polished, not overdone
3. **Progressive Validation is Excellent UX** - Not annoying, very helpful
4. **Checkbox Toggle Pattern is Clean** - Lucide icons (CheckSquare/Square) work perfectly
5. **Spring Physics Feel Natural** - Better than linear or ease transitions
6. **Build Times Stay Fast** - Even with more code, 3.2s is great
