     focusAreas: ['love', 'career', 'health'],
     interpretationStyle: 'mystical'
   });
   ```

   ```typescript
   await updateBirthData({
     birthDate: '2000-01-15',
     birthTime: '15:30',
     timeUnknown: false,
     birthLocation: {
       name: 'New York, NY, USA',
       latitude: 40.7128,
       longitude: -74.006,
       timezone: 'America/New_York',
       timezoneOffset: -18000,
       country: 'USA',
       region: 'NY'

## Comparison: React Native vs Web

### React Native (Original)
- 2-step flow: Categories → Style
- Birth data passed from BirthDateTimeScreen (separate)
- Uses `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`
- Platform-specific modals (iOS vs Android)
- TouchableOpacity for selection
- React Native StyleSheet
- Navigation via React Navigation

### Web (New)
- 6-step flow: Date → Time → Location → Categories → Style → Confirm
- All-in-one onboarding experience
- HTML5 date/time inputs
- Native browser pickers
- Button elements for selection
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Navigation via Next.js router

---

## Technical Implementation

### Form State Management
```typescript
const [data, setData] = useState<OnboardingData>({
  birthDate: '',
  birthTime: '',
  birthLocation: null,
  selectedCategories: [],
  interpretationStyle: null,
});
```

### Validation Pattern
```typescript
const validateDate = () => {
  if (!data.birthDate) {
    setDateError('Birth date is required');
    return false;
  }

  const date = new Date(data.birthDate);
  if (date > new Date()) {
    setDateError('Birth date cannot be in the future');
    return false;
  }

  setDateError('');
  return true;
};
```

### Location Search (Mock - TODO: Google Places API)
```typescript
const searchLocations = async (query: string) => {
  if (query.length < 3) return;

  // Mock data for now
  const mockLocations = [...];
  const filtered = mockLocations.filter(loc =>
    loc.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );

  setLocationSuggestions(filtered);
};
```

2. **Step 1:** Selects birth date (e.g., Jan 15, 2000)
3. **Step 2:** Enters birth time (e.g., 3:30 PM)
4. **Step 3:** Searches and selects location (e.g., "New York")
5. **Step 4:** Selects 3 focus areas (e.g., Love, Career, Health)
6. **Step 5:** Chooses interpretation style (e.g., Mystical)
7. **Step 6:** Reviews all information
8. Clicks "Complete"
9. Data saved to Supabase via store actions
10. Redirected to `/dashboard`
11. Chart generation begins in background

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Onboarding complete
- ⏳ Dashboard migration (next in Tier 1)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Google Places API Integration:**
   - Replace mock location data
   - Real-time geocoding
   - Accurate timezone detection
   - Address parsing for country/region

2. **Chart Generation Integration:**
   - Call `handleChartGeneration` on complete
   - Show loading state during calculation
   - Display success/error messages
   - Navigate to chart view after generation

3. **Progressive Enhancement:**
   - Save draft onboarding data to localStorage
   - Resume from last step if interrupted
   - Allow skipping time if unknown
   - Optional astrology knowledge level question

---

## Key Learnings

1. **StepWizard Component is Powerful** - Handles all navigation, validation, and transitions automatically
2. **HTML5 Inputs are Great for Web** - Native date/time pickers work well with dark mode
3. **Mock Data is Fine for Development** - Can integrate Google Places API later
4. **6-Step Flow Feels Natural** - Better UX than cramming everything into fewer steps
5. **Validation Per Step Works Well** - Prevents proceeding without required data
6. **Stagger Animations Add Polish** - Makes the experience feel premium

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Location Search:** Currently uses mock data
   - TODO: Integrate Google Places API
   - TODO: Add geolocation auto-detect

2. **Chart Generation:** Not triggered on complete
   - TODO: Call Swiss Ephemeris calculations
   - TODO: Show loading/progress
   - TODO: Handle errors gracefully

3. **Draft Saving:** No localStorage persistence
   - TODO: Save progress as user completes steps
   - TODO: Resume from last step on return
