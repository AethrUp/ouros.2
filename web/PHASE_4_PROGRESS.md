## Upcoming Work (Tier 1 - Critical Path)

### 4. Date/Time Picker Components (Required for Onboarding)
**Files to Create:**
- `web/components/ui/DatePicker.tsx`
- `web/components/ui/TimePicker.tsx`

**Requirements:**
- Replace `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`
- Web-native HTML5 inputs or react-datepicker library
- Consistent styling with design system
- Validation (past dates only for birth date)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation)
- Mobile-friendly touch targets

**Options:**
1. HTML5 `<input type="date">` + `<input type="time">` (simple, native)
2. react-datepicker library (better UX, more control)
3. Custom component with date-fns (full control, more work)

**Recommendation:** Start with HTML5, enhance if needed

---

### 5. Step Wizard Component (Required for Onboarding)
**File to Create:**
- `web/components/ui/StepWizard.tsx`

**Requirements:**
- Multi-step form management
- Progress indicator (dots or bar)
- Back/Next navigation
- Step validation
- Slide transitions between steps
- Responsive design

**Features:**
- Step state management
- Validation per step
- Can't proceed without valid data
- Back button support
- Skip functionality (optional)

---

### 6. Onboarding Flow Migration
**File:** `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx`
**Status:** Stub exists, needs complete implementation

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Birth date picker
2. Birth time picker
3. Birth location (Google Places)
4. Confirmation screen

**Components Needed:**
- StepWizard
- DatePicker
- TimePicker
- LocationPicker (adapt from React Native)
- Button
- Input
- Progress indicator

**Complexity:** HIGH (3 custom components + Google Places integration)

---

### 7. Dashboard/HomeScreen Migration
**File:** `web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Status:** Stub exists, needs complete implementation

**Sections (7 total, sequential fade-in):**
1. Daily horoscope card
2. Transit effectiveness graph (SVG chart)
3. Transit strength bars
4. Cosmic weather chart (SVG chart)
5. Category insights cards
6. Journal prompts
7. Synastry/quick actions

**Components Needed (New):**
- TransitEffectivenessGraph (web SVG version)
- TransitStrengthBar (web version)
- CosmicWeatherChart (web SVG version)

**Existing Components to Use:**
- Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent
- Button
- Badge
- LoadingScreen

**Complexity:** VERY HIGH (complex SVG charts + many dynamic sections)

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Animation Library: Framer Motion ✅
- **Rationale:** Excellent web performance, React-first, great docs
- **Implementation:** All animations use presets from `lib/animations.ts`
- **Pattern:** staggerContainer + staggerItem for sequential reveals

### 2. Form Validation: Inline State ✅
- **Rationale:** Simple, no extra deps, instant feedback
- **Pattern:** Validate on blur + real-time during typing after first error
- **Future:** Consider react-hook-form + zod for complex forms

### 3. Social Login: UI Only (TODO: Implementation)
- **Status:** Buttons present, handlers stubbed
- **Next Step:** Implement Supabase social auth
- **Providers:** Google + Apple (as per React Native version)

---

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **✅ DONE:** Enhance Login screen
2. **🔨 NEXT:** Enhance Register screen
3. **⏭️ AFTER:** Build DatePicker + TimePicker
4. **⏭️ AFTER:** Build StepWizard
5. **⏭️ AFTER:** Migrate Onboarding flow
6. **⏭️ AFTER:** Build chart components (Transit graphs)
7. **⏭️ AFTER:** Migrate Dashboard/HomeScreen

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Date/Time Picker for Web
**Problem:** React Native datetimepicker doesn't work on web
**Solution Options:**
1. HTML5 native (simple, limited styling)
2. react-datepicker (popular, good UX)
3. Custom with date-fns (full control)

**Decision:** TBD - will evaluate after Register screen

### Challenge 2: SVG Charts (Transit Graphs)
**Problem:** React Native SVG → Web SVG differences
**Solution:** Use standard SVG, rebuild charts for web
**Note:** React Native SVG usually works on web with minor adjustments

### Challenge 3: Sequential Animations (7 sections)
**Problem:** HomeScreen has complex sequential fade-ins
**Solution:** ✅ SOLVED - Use `sequentialFadeIn(index, delay)` from animations.ts

---

## Build Health

```bash
✅ Latest build: SUCCESS
✅ TypeScript: No errors
✅ Component library: Complete
✅ Animation library: Complete
✅ Design system: Established
```

**Current Build Time:** ~3.8s (excellent)

---

## Timeline Progress

**Original Estimate:** 5 weeks (25 working days)
**Days Elapsed:** 1
**Days Remaining:** 24

**Week 1 Goal:** Complete Critical Path (Auth + Onboarding + Dashboard)
**Week 1 Progress:** 25% (1 of 4 screens enhanced)

**On Track:** ✅ YES

---

## Key Learnings So Far

1. **Framer Motion is Perfect** - The animation presets work great, stagger effects are smooth
2. **Input Component is Powerful** - Icon support + password toggle + validation = winning combo
3. **Build Times Are Fast** - 3.8s builds mean rapid iteration
4. **Component Library Pays Off** - Zero time spent on basic UI, focus on features
5. **TypeScript Catches Errors Early** - Type safety prevents runtime issues
