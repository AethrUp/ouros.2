## Current Prompt Structure

```
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no explanatory text before or after.

You are a professional astrologer writing a comprehensive daily horoscope for ${date}.

WRITING STYLE & TONE:
You're writing a daily horoscope that feels like getting insights from a knowledgeable friend who happens to know astrology really well.

Tone:
- Conversational and warm, like you're talking to someone over coffee
- Confident but not preachy - you're sharing insights, not commanding
- Supportive and empowering - focus on opportunities and growth
- Honest about challenges but frame them constructively

Language Level:
- Write for someone who might know their sun sign but not much else
- Avoid astrological jargon - instead of "Mercury conjunct natal Mercury" say "communication is extra sharp today"
- When you must use astro terms, briefly explain them in plain language
- Use everyday situations people can relate to

Content Approach:
- Be specific, not vague - instead of "good day for relationships" say "conversations with partners flow more easily today"
- Connect to real life - tie cosmic influences to actual situations like work meetings, family dinners, or personal decisions
- Give actionable advice - what can they actually DO with this information?
- Acknowledge their unique chart - this isn't a generic sun sign reading, it's personalized to their specific planetary positions

What to Avoid:
- Mystical fluff: Skip phrases like "the cosmos whispers" or "celestial energies dance"
- Doom and gloom: Even challenging transits can be framed as growth opportunities
- Vague predictions: "Something important will happen" tells them nothing useful
- Overwhelming detail: They don't need to know exact degrees and orbs
- Generic advice: Make it relevant to their specific planetary setup

What to Include:
- Practical timing: "This morning is better for important conversations than this evening"
- Emotional context: "You might feel more sensitive than usual, and that's actually helpful for..."
- Opportunity spotting: "Pay attention to..." or "This is a good day to..."
- Challenge navigation: "If you're feeling frustrated with X, try Y approach"
- Personal validation: Reference how this connects to their natural traits

Key Principles:
- Relevance over accuracy: Better to give them something useful than technically perfect
- Clarity over complexity: Simple insights they can actually use
- Personal over generic: Tie it to their specific chart positions
- Practical over mystical: How does this help them navigate their actual day?
- Complete, standalone reading: No questions or prompts for further discussion

Sample Language Transformation:
- Instead of: "Saturn squares your natal Moon creating emotional challenges"
  Write: "You might feel more serious or slightly overwhelmed emotionally today"
- Instead of: "Venus trine Jupiter brings abundance"
  Write: "Good vibes around money, relationships, or things you enjoy are highlighted"
- Instead of: "Mercury retrograde conjunct natal Mercury"
  Write: "Communication and thinking might feel more introspective than usual"
- Instead of: "Cosmic energies are shifting"
  Write: "The day's energy supports..." or "You'll likely notice..."

## Data Sections Explained

### NATAL CHART POSITIONS
**Purpose:** User's birth chart positions (fixed, never changes)
**Format:**
```
- Natal Sun: Leo 15.3° (House 4)
- Natal Moon: Sagittarius 25.1° (House 9)
- Natal Chiron: Cancer 10.5° (House 3)
...
```

### CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS
**Purpose:** Where planets are in the sky TODAY (for general context)
**Format:**
```
- Sun: Libra 17.2°
- Moon: Pisces 8.5°
- Chiron: Aries 0.0°
...
```

### CURRENT TRANSITS
**Purpose:** Calculated aspects between TODAY's planets and natal planets (THE MAIN DATA)
**Format:**
```
- Mars Trine natal Chiron (1.9° orb, 75% strength)
- Venus Square natal Sun (3.2° orb, 60% strength)
...
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Only top 8 strongest transits are included!

## Identified Issues

### 1. ❌ No Purpose Explanation
The prompt does NOT explain what each data section is for:
- LLM doesn't know "CURRENT TRANSITS" are the ONLY aspects to interpret
- LLM doesn't know "CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS" is just for context

### 2. ❌ No Constraints on Aspect Calculation
Nothing prevents the LLM from:
- Seeing natal Chiron (Cancer 10°) and current Chiron (Aries 0°)
- Calculating the aspect itself (~90° square)
- Discussing aspects NOT in the CURRENT TRANSITS list

### 3. ❌ Missing Temperature Setting
- No temperature parameter set in `horoscopeGeneration.ts` line 115-124
- Defaults to 1.0 (maximum creativity/hallucination)
- Should be 0.3-0.5 for factual interpretation

### 4. ❌ Ambiguous Section Names
- "CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS" sounds like it's for calculating transits
- Should be renamed to clarify it's background context only

---

## Problem Example

**What LLM sees:**
```
NATAL CHART POSITIONS:
- Natal Chiron: Cancer 10.5°

CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS:
- Chiron: Aries 0.0°

CURRENT TRANSITS:
- Mars Trine natal Chiron (1.9° orb, 75% strength)
- Chiron Trine natal Sun (0.5° orb, 94% strength)
[NO "Chiron to natal Chiron" listed - API doesn't calculate it]
```

**What LLM does:**
1. Sees natal Chiron at Cancer 10° and current Chiron at Aries 0°
2. Calculates ~90° square aspect in its head
3. Draws on general knowledge that "Chiron returns happen at age 50"
4. Incorrectly discusses "Chiron return" even though:
   - No Chiron-to-Chiron aspect is in CURRENT TRANSITS
   - User is 35, not 50
   - It's a square, not a conjunction

---

## Proposed Fixes

### Fix 1: Add Data Section Explanations
Add this BEFORE the CONTEXT section:

```
HOW TO USE THIS DATA:

1. NATAL CHART POSITIONS = User's birth chart (fixed reference points)
   - Use this to understand their core nature and what planets are being activated

2. CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS = Today's sky (general background context)
   - Use this ONLY for describing general cosmic weather (e.g., "Moon in Pisces today")
   - DO NOT calculate aspects from this data yourself

3. CURRENT TRANSITS = Pre-calculated aspects (YOUR PRIMARY DATA)
   - These are the ONLY aspects you should interpret
   - If an aspect is not listed here, DO NOT discuss it
   - These have been professionally calculated with proper orbs and strength ratings

IMPORTANT: Only interpret aspects listed in CURRENT TRANSITS. Do not calculate additional aspects yourself, even if you can infer them from the natal and current positions.
```

### Fix 2: Add Temperature Parameter
In `horoscopeGeneration.ts` line 115-124, add:
```typescript
temperature: 0.4  // Lower = more literal interpretation, less hallucination
```

### Fix 3: Strengthen CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
Add to the requirements list:
```
11. ONLY interpret transit aspects explicitly listed in CURRENT TRANSITS
12. DO NOT calculate aspects between CURRENT PLANETARY POSITIONS and NATAL CHART POSITIONS yourself
13. If you cannot find an aspect in CURRENT TRANSITS, do not mention it
14. Base all transit interpretations on the provided aspect list only
```

## Notes

- The API correctly calculates transits from Swiss Ephemeris
- The caching works correctly (new forecast each day)
- The problem is purely in prompt clarity and LLM temperature
- LLM is too creative with default temp 1.0
- No constraints on what data to use for interpretation
