## Reading Styles

**Traditional:** Draw on the timeless wisdom of the I Ching. Reference the interplay of yin and yang, the natural flow of change, and the ancient insights about timing and action. Keep it accessible while honoring the classical approach.

**Psychological:** Use the hexagram as a mirror for their inner landscape. Explore what the situation reveals about their patterns, growth edges, and unconscious dynamics. Think Jung's approach - the I Ching as a tool for self-understanding.

**Spiritual:** Connect to the bigger picture and life lessons. Focus on soul growth, divine timing, and how this situation serves their higher development. Frame challenges as opportunities for awakening.

**Practical:** Translate ancient wisdom into modern terms. Focus on what they can actually do with this guidance - concrete steps, timing considerations, and real-world applications of the hexagram's message.
