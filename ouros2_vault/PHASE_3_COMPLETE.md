# Phase 3 Complete: Webhook Integration

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing
**Next Phase**: Phase 4 - Subscription Management (Customer Portal)

---

## Overview

Phase 3 implements webhook handling, which is the critical piece that makes subscriptions actually work. When users subscribe through Stripe Checkout, Stripe sends webhook events to your server to notify you of subscription changes.

**This phase enables**:
- ✅ Automatic database updates when users subscribe
- ✅ Subscription status synchronization with Stripe
- ✅ Payment success/failure tracking
- ✅ Subscription cancellation handling
- ✅ Complete audit trail of all events

---

## What Was Built

### 1. ✅ Webhook Handler API Route

**File**: `web/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`

**Functionality**:
1. **Signature Verification**: Validates requests came from Stripe
2. **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate processing of same event
3. **Event Routing**: Dispatches to appropriate handler based on event type
4. **Audit Logging**: Stores all events in `stripe_webhook_events` table
5. **Error Handling**: Returns 500 on errors so Stripe will retry

**Security**:
- Verifies `stripe-signature` header
- Uses `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to validate authenticity
- Rejects invalid signatures with 400 status
- Prevents replay attacks

---

### 2. ✅ Event Handlers

#### Subscription Created/Updated

**Event**: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`

**Handler**: `handleSubscriptionUpdate()`

**What it does**:
1. Extracts `user_id` and `tier` from subscription metadata
2. Maps Stripe status to our status enum:
   - `active` → 'active'
   - `trialing` → 'trial'
   - `canceled` → 'cancelled'
   - `past_due` → 'grace_period'
   - `unpaid` → 'expired'
3. Updates `subscription_state` table (upsert):
   - Sets tier (premium/pro)
   - Sets status (active/trial/etc.)
   - Stores Stripe IDs (subscription, customer, price)
   - Sets period start/end dates
   - Sets expiry date
   - Sets platform to 'web'
4. Logs event to `subscription_history`

**Result**: User's subscription is now active in your database!

#### Subscription Deleted

**Event**: `customer.subscription.deleted`

**Handler**: `handleSubscriptionDeleted()`

**What it does**:
1. Finds user by subscription metadata
2. Updates `subscription_state` status to 'cancelled'
3. Logs cancellation to `subscription_history`

**Result**: User loses access when subscription ends

#### Payment Succeeded

**Event**: `invoice.payment_succeeded`

**Handler**: `handlePaymentSucceeded()`

**What it does**:
1. Retrieves subscription from invoice
2. Logs successful payment to `subscription_history`
3. Could trigger receipt email (not implemented yet)

**Result**: Payment success is recorded

#### Payment Failed

**Event**: `invoice.payment_failed`

**Handler**: `handlePaymentFailed()`

**What it does**:
1. Retrieves subscription from invoice
2. Updates status to 'grace_period' if subscription is past_due
3. Logs failed payment to `subscription_history`
4. Could trigger payment failure email (not implemented yet)

**Result**: User enters grace period, retains access temporarily

#### Trial Will End

**Event**: `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`

**Handler**: `handleTrialWillEnd()`

**What it does**:
1. Logs trial ending date
2. Could trigger reminder email (not implemented yet)

**Result**: Awareness of upcoming trial end

---

### 3. ✅ Database Integration

#### subscription_state Updates

All subscription changes are written to `subscription_state`:

```typescript
{
  user_id: 'abc123',
  tier: 'premium',
  status: 'active',
  platform: 'web',
  stripe_subscription_id: 'sub_123',
  stripe_customer_id: 'cus_123',
  stripe_price_id: 'price_123',
  current_period_start: '2025-10-26T00:00:00Z',
  current_period_end: '2025-11-26T00:00:00Z',
  cancel_at_period_end: false,
  expires_at: '2025-11-26T00:00:00Z',
  updated_at: '2025-10-26T12:34:56Z'
}
```

#### subscription_history Audit Trail

All events are logged for audit purposes:

```typescript
{
  user_id: 'abc123',
  tier: 'premium',
  status: 'active',
  platform: 'web',
  stripe_subscription_id: 'sub_123',
  stripe_customer_id: 'cus_123',
  event_type: 'subscription_started',
  created_at: '2025-10-26T12:34:56Z'
}
```

Event types logged:
- `subscription_started`
- `subscription_updated`
- `subscription_cancelled`
- `payment_succeeded`
- `payment_failed`

#### stripe_webhook_events Logging

All webhook events are stored:

```typescript
{
  id: 'uuid',
  stripe_event_id: 'evt_123',
  event_type: 'customer.subscription.created',
  payload: { /* full Stripe event object */ },
  processed: true,
  processed_at: '2025-10-26T12:34:56Z',
  error: null,
  created_at: '2025-10-26T12:34:56Z'
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Idempotency (prevent duplicate processing)
- Audit trail (know what happened and when)
- Debugging (see full event payloads)
- Replay (can reprocess failed events)

## How It Works

### Complete Flow: User Subscribes

```
1. User completes checkout on Stripe
   ↓
2. Stripe creates subscription
   ↓
3. Stripe sends webhook: customer.subscription.created
   ↓
4. Your webhook endpoint receives POST request
   ↓
5. Verify signature (is this really from Stripe?)
   ↓
6. Check idempotency (have we seen this event before?)
   ↓
7. Log event to stripe_webhook_events (processed=false)
   ↓
8. Route to handleSubscriptionUpdate()
   ↓
9. Extract metadata (user_id, tier)
   ↓
10. Update subscription_state (tier, status, IDs, dates)
   ↓
11. Log to subscription_history
   ↓
12. Mark event as processed (processed=true)
   ↓
13. Return 200 OK to Stripe
   ↓
14. User now has active subscription in database! ✅
```

### Handling Failures

If webhook processing fails:

```
1. Webhook receives event
   ↓
2. Processing fails (e.g., database error)
   ↓
3. Log error to stripe_webhook_events
   ↓
4. Return 500 to Stripe
   ↓
5. Stripe retries the webhook (automatic)
   ↓
6. Eventually succeeds or you fix the issue
```

Stripe will retry failed webhooks automatically with exponential backoff.

## Testing the Webhooks

### Prerequisites

1. ✅ Database migration run (has Stripe fields)
2. ✅ Phase 1 complete (Stripe SDK installed)
3. ✅ Phase 2 complete (checkout working)
4. ✅ Environment variables set
5. ✅ Dev server running

### Install Stripe CLI

**Windows**:
```bash
scoop install stripe
```

**Mac**:
```bash
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
```

**Linux**:
```bash
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.19.4/stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin/
```

### Test Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
cd web
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Forward webhooks
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_...) to web/.env.local
# Restart dev server

# Terminal 3 (or browser): Test checkout
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/pricing
# Complete a purchase with test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
```

### What to Watch For

**In Stripe CLI terminal** (Terminal 2):
```
2025-10-26 12:34:56   --> customer.subscription.created [evt_abc123]
2025-10-26 12:34:57   <--  [200] POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe [evt_abc123]
```

**In dev server terminal** (Terminal 1):
```
[Webhook] Received event: customer.subscription.created (evt_abc123)
[Webhook] Updating subscription for user xxx to premium
[Webhook] Successfully updated subscription for user xxx
[Webhook] Successfully processed event: evt_abc123
```

**In Supabase**:
- Check `subscription_state`: tier should be 'premium' or 'pro', status 'active'
- Check `subscription_history`: should have 'subscription_started' event
- Check `stripe_webhook_events`: should have processed=true

---

## What's NOT Included (Yet)

Phase 3 handles webhook processing, but doesn't include:

❌ **Feature gating in APIs** - APIs don't check subscription yet (will add incrementally)
❌ **Usage tracking** - APIs don't increment usage counts yet
❌ **Customer portal** - Users can't manage subscriptions (Phase 4)
❌ **Email notifications** - No automated emails (can configure in Stripe Dashboard)
❌ **Subscription upgrades/downgrades** - No in-app upgrade flow yet (Phase 4)

These will be added in Phase 4 and beyond.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Email Notifications**: You can configure Stripe to send emails (Dashboard → Settings → Emails)
2. **No Upgrade/Downgrade Flow**: Users would need to cancel and re-subscribe (Phase 4 will fix)
3. **No Feature Enforcement Yet**: APIs accept all requests regardless of tier (will add incrementally)
4. **No Usage Tracking Yet**: APIs don't increment usage counts (will add incrementally)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Signature Verification Failed

**Problem**: `Invalid signature` error

**Solution**:
1. Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`
2. Make sure it matches the secret from `stripe listen`
3. Restart dev server after changing

### Missing user_id in Metadata

**Problem**: `Missing user_id in subscription metadata` error

**Solution**:
- This happens when manually triggering events with `stripe trigger`
- Use actual checkout flow for complete testing
- Metadata is added in Phase 2 checkout session creation

### Database Not Updating

**Problem**: Webhook processes but database unchanged

**Check**:
1. Supabase credentials correct
2. Table names match (`subscription_state`, not `subscriptions`)
3. Check Supabase logs for errors
4. Verify RLS policies allow inserts/updates

### Events Not Reaching Webhook

**Problem**: Stripe CLI shows events but webhook not called

**Solution**:
1. Check Stripe CLI is forwarding to correct URL
2. Verify dev server is running on port 3000
3. Check no firewall blocking localhost requests

---

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

### 1. Create Production Webhook

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Switch to **Live mode**
3. Click **+ Add endpoint**
4. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
5. Select events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
   - `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
6. Click **Add endpoint**
7. Copy the **Signing secret**

### 2. Update Production Environment

Add to production environment variables:
```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[PRODUCTION_SECRET]
```

**Important**: Production secret is different from development!

### 3. Test Production Webhooks

After deploying:
1. Complete a real subscription purchase
2. Check Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
3. Verify webhook delivered successfully (200 status)
4. Check production database
5. Check production logs

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Test webhook flow locally** using Stripe CLI
2. **Verify database updates** after test purchase
3. **Check all events are logged** properly

### Phase 4: Subscription Management

Next phase will implement:

1. **Customer Portal** - Stripe-hosted subscription management
2. **Billing History** - View past invoices
3. **Payment Method Updates** - Change credit card
4. **Cancellation Flow** - Cancel subscription
5. **Upgrade/Downgrade** - Change plans

### Future Phases

- **Feature Gating**: Add middleware to API routes
