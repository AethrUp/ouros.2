# Phase 4 Complete: Subscription Management

**Date Completed**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing
**Next Phase**: Phase 5 - Production Preparation

---

## Overview

Phase 4 implements subscription management using Stripe's Customer Portal. This gives users complete control over their subscriptions without you having to build custom UI for every management scenario.

**This phase enables**:
- ✅ View subscription details and status
- ✅ Update payment methods
- ✅ View billing history and download invoices
- ✅ Cancel or reactivate subscriptions
- ✅ Update billing information
- ✅ Upgrade/downgrade plans (handled by Stripe)

---

## What Was Built

### 1. ✅ Customer Portal Session API

**File**: `web/app/api/stripe/create-portal-session/route.ts`

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/stripe/create-portal-session`

**Functionality**:
1. Authenticates user via Supabase
2. Retrieves Stripe customer ID from `subscription_state`
3. Creates Stripe Customer Portal session
4. Returns portal URL for redirect

**Security**:
- User authentication required
- Only allows access to user's own subscription
- Returns URL to Stripe-hosted portal (PCI compliant)

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "url": "https://billing.stripe.com/p/session/..."
}
```

---

### 2. ✅ Manage Subscription Button Component

**File**: `web/components/subscription/ManageSubscriptionButton.tsx`

**Props**:
- `variant`: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'ghost'
- `size`: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
- `fullWidth`: boolean
- `children`: Custom button text

**Features**:
- Loading state during portal session creation
- Error handling with display
- Automatic redirect to Customer Portal
- Reusable across the application

**Usage**:
```tsx
<ManageSubscriptionButton
  variant="secondary"
  size="medium"
  fullWidth
>
  Manage Subscription
</ManageSubscriptionButton>
```

---

### 3. ✅ Subscription Info Component

**File**: `web/components/subscription/SubscriptionInfo.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Displays subscription details**:
  - Current tier (Free, Premium, Pro)
  - Status (Active, Trial, Cancelled, etc.)
  - Next billing date
  - Cancellation status

- **Smart status indicators**:
  - Green badge for Active
  - Blue for Trial
  - Yellow for Payment Issue/Grace Period
  - Gray for Cancelled
  - Red for Expired

- **Contextual actions**:
  - Free tier: Shows upgrade button
  - Paid tier: Shows manage subscription button

- **Warning messages**:
  - Cancellation pending (access until date)
  - Payment issues (grace period)

- **Loading states**: Skeleton loader while fetching
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages

**Design**: Matches Ouros2 aesthetic with gradient backgrounds and gold accents

---

### 4. ✅ Profile Page Integration

**File**: `web/app/profile/page.tsx` (updated)

**Changes**:
- Added `<SubscriptionInfo />` component
- Removed placeholder "Manage Subscription" button
- Positioned subscription info between birth data and account settings

**User Experience**:
- Users see their subscription status on profile page
- One-click access to subscription management
- Clear upgrade path for free users

## How It Works

### Customer Portal Flow

```
1. User clicks "Manage Subscription" button
   ↓
2. Button calls /api/stripe/create-portal-session
   ↓
3. API retrieves Stripe customer ID from database
   ↓
4. API creates Stripe Customer Portal session
   ↓
5. User redirects to billing.stripe.com
   ↓
6. User manages subscription on Stripe's portal
   ↓
7. User clicks "Return" when done
   ↓
8. Redirects back to /profile (or /settings)
   ↓
9. Any changes sync via webhooks automatically ✅
```

### What Users Can Do in Customer Portal

Stripe's Customer Portal allows users to:

1. **View Subscription**:
   - Current plan
   - Next billing date
   - Billing amount

2. **Update Payment Method**:
   - Add new credit card
   - Remove old card
   - Set default payment method

3. **View Billing History**:
   - See all past invoices
   - Download invoice PDFs
   - View payment status

4. **Cancel Subscription**:
   - Cancel immediately
   - Cancel at period end (recommended)
   - See when access ends

5. **Reactivate Subscription**:
   - If cancelled but still in billing period
   - Reactivate with same plan

6. **Update Billing Info**:
   - Change billing address
   - Update tax information

### Webhook Integration

When users make changes in the portal, Stripe sends webhooks:

```
User cancels subscription in portal
  ↓
Stripe sends: customer.subscription.updated (cancel_at_period_end: true)
  ↓
Your webhook handler updates database
  ↓
SubscriptionInfo component shows "Access until [date]"
```

## What's NOT Included (Yet)

Phase 4 focuses on subscription management. The following are NOT yet implemented:

❌ **In-app upgrade/downgrade** - Users can upgrade via pricing page, but no in-portal upgrade yet
❌ **Custom cancellation flow** - Uses Stripe's default (which is fine)
❌ **Retention prompts** - No custom retention messaging (can add later)
❌ **Email notifications** - Stripe sends default emails (can customize)
❌ **Pause subscription** - Not enabled (can add if needed)

These are nice-to-haves and can be added later if needed.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Portal Branding**: Requires manual setup in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Cancellation Feedback**: Collected by Stripe, not in your database (you can export from Stripe)
3. **No Trial Offers**: Portal doesn't handle trial extensions (would need custom implementation)
4. **No Promo Codes in Portal**: Users can't apply coupons in portal (only at checkout)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No subscription found" Error

**Problem**: User clicks "Manage Subscription" but gets error

**Solutions**:
1. Check `subscription_state` has `stripe_customer_id`
2. Verify webhook processed subscription creation
3. Check user is logged in
4. Ensure subscription exists in Stripe

### Portal Not Configured Error

**Problem**: Portal redirect fails

**Solutions**:
1. Activate Customer Portal in Stripe Dashboard
2. Check portal is activated for correct mode (test vs live)
3. Verify portal URL is accessible

### Changes Not Reflected in App

**Problem**: User cancels in portal but app still shows active

**Solutions**:
1. Check webhooks are working (Phase 3)
2. Verify `customer.subscription.updated` webhook received
3. Check database updated with `cancel_at_period_end: true`
4. Hard refresh the profile page

### Free Users See "Manage Subscription"

**Problem**: Free tier users shouldn't see manage button

**Solution**: SubscriptionInfo component already handles this - shows "Upgrade" instead

---

## Production Deployment

### Before Going Live

1. **Configure Live Portal**:
   - Switch to Live mode in Stripe Dashboard
   - Go to Settings → Billing → Customer Portal
   - Activate live portal
   - Configure same settings as test mode

2. **Update Branding**:
   - Upload production logo
   - Set brand colors
   - Add support contact info

3. **Test in Production**:
   - Create real subscription (small amount)
   - Test portal access
   - Test cancellation flow
   - Verify webhooks work

4. **Monitor**:
   - Watch for portal access errors
   - Monitor cancellation rates
   - Check webhook delivery

## Customer Support Scenarios

### User Can't Access Portal

3. Proration handled automatically by Stripe

### User Wants Refund
